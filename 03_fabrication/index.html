  <h4><b>Kinetic Sculpture: The Deadlifter</b></h4>
  <p></p>
  Initially, I was inspired to use a Geneva Drive to create some kind of kinetic sculpture that translated continuous rotational movement into periodic
  movement. After exploring how the mechanism is used in a lot of modern-day applications (industrial machines, projectors, and <b>watches</b>), I
  finally settled on using it to create some kind of display that uses the vertical movement created by the drive. Here is a drawing I made of the
  Geneva mechanism that I had in mind:
  <p></p>
  <div class="flexrow"><img src="geneva_drawing.jpeg" alt="geneva_drawing" style="width:30%" border="3px"></div>
  <p></p>
  Now I had to choose what to put on display using this mechanism. After cycling through a lot of random ideas, I remembered when almost 2 years ago,
  I injured my back deadlifting at the gym and have not deadlifted since. My thought for this project was, maybe I could
  use the vertical motion to create a mechanism to show correct(ish) form for deadlifting! After some more thought about the complexity of correct form
  for the deadlift and how it would be difficult to get it exactly right, I decided to settle for semi-correct form (so, don't use this project in place of
  a good personal trainer!).
  <p></p>
  After more deliberation, I realized that the movement of a deadlift doesn't really follow a timed toggle like the Geneva drive creates. It's more of a
  slow pull upwards followed by a release at the top of the lift. A more suitable mechanism for this movement would be the little snail-shaped wheel that
  we used in building automata in Lab. Here are some drawings from my rough design sketches:
  <p></p>

  The first iteration of the box, deadlifter, and barbell is shown below:<p></p>

  <p></p>
  The initial design revealed some challenges that I didn't anticipate. First, I faced some trouble sizing the parameters to reasonable dimensions, ensuring
  that all the pieces fit well together. This challenge was enhanced because of the high number of pieces that this project includes. After printing out all
  of the pieces and assembling them, it became clear that there were a lot more problems. First, the wooden dowel I used to connect the wheel-motor mechanism to
  the body of the deadlifter introduced a problem of balance between friction and stability---the hole cut through the top piece of the box was too big, but upon
  making it smaller it had too much friction. Also, the snail cam mechanism was really hard to get right, so I decided to switch over to a round cam
  with a plastic dowel attached to the edge, driven in a circular motion to produce a constant up-and-down motion.
  <p></p>
  After what seemed like a million different versions of the box and figure, I eventually settled on using a larger torso of the deadlifter to enable more
  freedom of movement for the dowel. The pivot point for this movement would be on the deadlifter's back, and the larger torso made it so that the dowel
  did not run into any of the screw-nut joints on the body.<p></p>

  Another problem I ran into was in making sure that the deadlifter's legs did not cave inwards. To treat this problem, I used rubber bands to secure the
  arms/barbell fixture to the thighs. This unfortunately limited the arm movement, but worked well enough to keep the legs bent outwards.<p></p>

  The last piece of the puzzle was fixing the motor to the box, which was pretty easy but required some experimentation with what the best positioning
  was. Some positions caused the deadlifter to only lift with one leg, and other positions caused a rocking motion. I eventually found a nice middle ground
  where the deadlifter goes (more or less) straight up and down.<p></p>
