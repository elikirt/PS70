  Hi! I'm a senior at Harvard studying Applied Mathematics. I generally really enjoy creating things, from ceramic mugs in the pottery studio,
  to house music tracks on Ableton, to woodworking projects in my backyard at home. I also have a dog:<p></p>

  A lot of my interests are centered around music. I grew up playing a lot of piano and some violin &mdash; during college I've rediscovered my
  love for music, and picked up music production as a casual hobby (check out my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/elijak">Soundcloud!</a>), mostly
  working on house/electronic tracks. I'm always looking for new music &mdash; current favorites are Gorillaz, Aphex Twin, and various jazz artists
  like Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans.

  <b>Why I'm Excited To Take PS 70</b>
  <p></p>
  In high school, I took a prototyping class, where I learned
  the ins and outs of the wood shop and spent a lot of time at the table saw, lathe, and other high-power tools. Our school also had a waterjet,
  CNC mill, and multiple 3D printers. All of this exposed me to the joys of building, and I came out of that class having made a few cool wood
  projects. I decided to take PS 70 in part due to the influence of this high school class &mdash; I want to build some really cool stuff this semester, 
  that involves not just basic wooden structures but other materials like polycarbonate, acrylic, metal, glass, etc. Incorporating circuitry with
  Raspberry Pi / Arduino makes the project ideas even more exciting. I am heavily influenced by beautiful wooden artworks like Japanese lacquer-wood
  boxes or really nice wooden tables. I've always been keen on the intersection between design, aesthetics, and function, and want to produce a project
  that incorporates a healthy balance of those features. Music is also a huge interest of mine (broadly speaking) and I think it would be cool to
  tie that in to the final project as well.
